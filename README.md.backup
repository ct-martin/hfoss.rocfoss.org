# HFOSS Course Website

This site has three main goals:

* Clean migration of content from [ofCourse](http://github.com/FOSSRIT/ofCourse))
* Run anywhere
* CI (inc. against PRs)

To this end the following things have been done:

* A `migrate.sh` script
* Choosing Jekyll to run the site, [Quickstart & install docs here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
* GitLab CI

Content exists in two forms:

* Markdown (`.md`) files for page content
* People in `people/$YYYY/$SEMESTER/_posts/$YYYY-01-01-$NICK.md` files via YAML front-matter

## People pages

This uses the same spec as ofCourse. If you need help, and the below isn't enough, take a look at other peoples' pages.

Required fields:

* `name` - human name
* `irc` - IRC/chat username
* `rit_dce` - RIT computer account username
* `blog` - URL of blog
* `feed` - RSS feed URL for blog
* `forge` - list of git "forges" (websites, e.g. GitHub, GitLab)

Optional, but highly encouraged, fields for people:

* `major` - program of study
* `bio` - short "about you"

Homework:

* Under `hw` field
* Format is `assignment_name: URL`
